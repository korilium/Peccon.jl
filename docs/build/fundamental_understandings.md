### Interest Rate 

Interest rates are a percentage of an initial capital and are calculated on a time horizon. For example 
a yearly interest rate of two percent on an initial capital of 1 000 euro will amount to 20 euro after one year, while a monthly interest rate of four percent for the same capital will return 40 euro per month. It is therefore important to remember two questions when faced with interest rates:

* On what time horizon is the interest calculated on? 
* To which initial investment does the interest rate refer to?

```{tab-item} Question 
what is a better investment? 
* 10% yearly interest rate on a 10 000 euro investment 
* 2% monthly interest rate on a 5 000 euro investment 

```

```{tab-item} Answer 
To compare the two option we first need to set the monthly interest rate to the yearly interest rate. This is done by multiplying 1.02 12x times 

$$ 1.02^{12} \approx 1.27 $$ 

Know we know that the monthly interest rate is actually 2.7x times larger then the 10% interest rate. Option two becomes therefore more attractive, but we still have to account for the initial capital: 


$$ 1.10 * 10000 = 11000 $$ 
$$ 1.27 * 5000  = 6350 $$

The second investment option actually gives us 350 euro more in return and that with a lower initial investment!
