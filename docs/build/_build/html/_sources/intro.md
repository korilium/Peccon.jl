# Intro

In this jupyter book you can find all the fin tools that have been developed to optimize investment, spending and income. 
These tools enable you to better anticipate your future financial well-being. 
The library is intended to give you an intuitional feel and a theoretical explanation about theses tools. This website is not intended to give any financial advice. It rather enables you to have the necessary tools to make your own decisions.  

Before we delve into specific tools, I will dedicate the first chapter to understanding practical concepts like interest rate, inflation and variance. These concepts are needed as they enable you to fully comprehend the basic implications of each tool.
