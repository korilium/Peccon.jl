## Modern Portfolio Theory 

First, the expected return of the portfolio is calculated: $$ E(R_P) = \sum_iw_iE(R_i) $$

where $R_P$ is the return on the portfolio, $R_i$ is the return on the asset $i$ and $w_i$ is the weight of asset $i$ in the portfolio such that:  $$\sum_i w_i = 1$$ 


Then the volatility of the portfolio can be expressed as follows : 

$$ \sigma^2_P  = \sum_i\sum_j w_iw_j\sigma_i\sigma_j\rho_{ij} $$
