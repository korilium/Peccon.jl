# Fundamental Understanding

In this subsection of the book we delve deeper into the main concepts behind financial planning. The general intuition will be given in the first part of this section, while in the last section the theoretical aspects will be discussed. It is highly recommended to at least <b>understand</b> the intuitional part of the fundamentals as this will enable you to better account for the limitations and the context of each tool.
